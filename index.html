                 <p>
                     The graph below is a data Visualization of what makes peopel happy. Researchers asked 10,000 participants to list ten things that recently made them happy. The result was HappyDB, a collection of 100,000 happy moments. For each moment, the designer parsed out the subject, verb, and object to better see what makes people happy overall. (https://flowingdata.com/2021/07/29/counting-happiness/)
                 </p><br>
        
                 <p>
                    It seems like a very interesting project at first glance.The data visualization successfuly suggests that people's happiness are relate to individual activites, as we can see a very big circle "I" in the canvas. Then we notice there are two groups of circles away from each other, the "I" group and "small barbles" group, and are in different colors. What does it mean? It took me quite a bit of time to understand the graph. 
                 </p><br>
                 <p>
                    The idiom choosen in this task is a Sankey chart, which is a visualisation technique that allows to display flows. The difficulty of reading the information from the graph can be analysised through it choice of data and idioms.

                <h4>Improvement (option 1):</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Re-organize the data in the "verb" and "object" groups. differeciate the data only base on the size of the data, rather the "I or others".
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Choose a gradient color system for the datas, rather than two discrete colors. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Circles in the "others" group should be layout in a linear arrangement, togethe with the "I", in relation to their data size.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Give more weight to the curves linking the circles. To show anothe laye of information: the flow and connectivity of the items.
                    </li>
